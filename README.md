This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Após criar o projeto com o comando yarn create react-app frontend , deletamos os arquivos que não utilizaremos.
O react trabalha com o conceito de componente, que para um entendimento mais rapido pode ser visto como uma função que retorna html (jsx).

adcionar a pasta assets (imagens e logos) dentro da pasta src.
modificar os arquivos app.js e app.css

para fazer as chamadas a nossa api vamos utilizar uma biblioteca chamada axios.

Dentro da pasta src, criaremos a pasta services e dentro dela o arquivo api.js que vai conter as informações de conexao da api utilizando o axios.

dentro de app.js importamos api.js
e proceguimos na configuração do api.js para fazer a chamada a api com o email passado pelo form

yarn add react-router-dom

ciar o arquivo routes.js dentro de src

para fazer a troca de paginas temos que usar o history como parametro da função. history.push('rota')
